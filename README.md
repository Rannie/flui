## Features

* A set of high-quality Flutter widgets out of the box
* Comprehensive usage examples and documentation
* Fine-grained non-stylized widgets for different types of applications
* Supports [Dark Mode](https://abtfun.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/2019-12-27-dark_shots.png) and [RTL](https://abtfun.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/img/2019-12-27-rtl_shots.png)

## Compatibility

**FLUI** has good compatibility on multiple clients, and the framework will be developed based on Flutter Stable Channel.

Currently supports *v1.12.13+hotfix.5* and above.

## Getting Started

#### Setup

```yaml
dependencies:
  flui: 0.8.0
```

Then run `flutter pub get` to download the dependencies.

#### Usage

After the dependency installation is completed, you can directly import the widget.

```dart
import 'package:flui/flui.dart';

// in somewhere
FLAppBarTitle(
    title: 'AppBar',
    subtitle: '(subtitle)',
    layout: FLAppBarTitleLayout.vertical,
    showLoading: true
)
```

## Contributing

Principles:

* Branches that submit new widgets should be named *'feature-'* + widget name. Fixing issues need to be prefixed with *'bugfix-'*
* The submitted widgets need to be general. If the widget is rare or not sure whether it needs to be added to **FLUI**, you can raise a [issue](https://github.com/Rannie/flui/issues) which starts with *\[feature\]* for discussion
* The API design of the new widget is as standard and readable as possible, following the naming and usage rules of Flutter's official widgets.
* Please comment above properties and methods how to use it so that I can add to the documentation and examples.
* Commit messages: prefix with `feat | fix | docs | style | refactor | perf | test | workflow | ci | chore | types:`.
